      PROGRAM F404
C        THIS TESTING PROGRAM RUNS THREE SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS WITH
C        NT = 1 AND 0. SYSTEM 1 IS WELL CONDITIONED, SYSTEM 2 ILL CONDI-
C        TIONED AND SYSTEM 3 IS SINGULAR. THE SIX OUTPUT NUMBERS SHOULD
C    BE ABOUT 11, ABOUT 1,0,1,1,0.  THIS TEST INCLUDES ALSO A TEST
C        OF TRISOL, WHICH IS CALLED BY TRIDIA.
